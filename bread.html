            <li>325 grams warm filtered water</li>
            <li>12 grams extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>120 grams unbleached flour (all-purpose or bread flour)</li>
            <li>12 grams salt</li>
            <li>Butter or cooking spray (for greasing the loaf pan)</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the active sourdough starter and warm filtered water. Mix well using a bread whisk or fork until most of the starter is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add extra virgin olive oil and honey (or sugar) to the mixture. Stir until evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>Gradually add unbleached flour to the mixture, followed by salt. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough in the bowl for about 3 minutes until it comes together and reaches a consistent texture.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, perform a series of stretch and folds on the dough. Repeat this process three more times, with 30 minutes of rest in between each set.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has almost doubled in size (about 3-4 hours), transfer it to a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a large rectangle. Use a lightly floured rolling pin to flatten the dough, working out all of the air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Fold one side of the dough toward the middle, and fold the other side to meet the first side in the middle. Roll the dough tightly into a loaf shape. Pinch and tuck the sides under.</li>
            <li>Place the dough seam side down in a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel and let the dough proof for 2 hours, or until it has almost doubled in size and fills the loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) during the last 30 minutes of proofing.</li>
            <li>Once fully proofed, place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 35 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the bread from the oven and immediately brush the top with butter. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. Enjoy!</li>
